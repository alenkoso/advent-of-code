## Intro

I first "discovered" AOC in 2020, while browsing reddit. I scrolled over some comments and saw how amazing the whole community there is, which made me think even more why not join the whole subreddit and even participate in the challenges.
It was the first of "rona" years, during one of the many lockdowns, so it was a good time to take upon something other than "just" gaming and training.

## Initial goal

I've been battling with myself for quite some time over an idea, whether I should start learning Python or not. I had some unexplained disklike towards it, but after I got started, I quickly saw that I was just being stubborn for no reason, Python is cool.

My initial goal became to get familiar with Python and learn something new, then, down the line I would broaden my knowledge of maybe something more.

## Sequence of challenges

Because it was 2020, I started with that year's challenge.

I did a big majority of the challenges by myself, but there were a few where I needed to check the subreddit with ideas, I talked with some people, etc, as I was just too confused at how to do something.

Later I started doing some 2015 challenges.

Last year I participated in the 2021 challenge and, even though I struggled a lot with the lack of time and understanding of some assignments, I decided to try and complete the challenge on time.

I had to do a few assignments "by hand", as I had no idea how to implement the solutions in code. You live and you learn. :)
