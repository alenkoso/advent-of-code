#### About

Each day contains two coding challenges. For each completed challenge, one receives a star.

In the end gold indicates the user got both stars for that day, silver means just the first star, and gray means none.

#### Goal

With this advent coding challenge I will sharpen my programming and problem solving skills whilst learning Python.
